## What do I need to purchase for this course?

The following are required items for this course, and their costs (in $CAD) are:

- Textbook ($XX)
- Access to online homework system ($XX)
- Lab Manual ($0)

Being very conscious of the high costs of education, I have made efforts to minimize the additional cost of taking this course.
Below is a justification of each required item and why I think you need it to succeed in this course.

```{warning}
Do not procrastinate buying access to the online homework system! You will need it right away.
```

### Textbook

The required **textbook** for this course is:

> [Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 4e by Randall D. Knight]()

and it is required because ----.

You may purchase either Volume 1 only or the full text.
The cost for a new physical textbook is $---.
It is also possible to get a digital textbook for $---.
Volume 1 contains all of the material required for PHYS 111 and will be lighter and more portable. If you purchase the full text, it will include Volume 2 which will (tentatively) be used in the second part of Introductory Physics for the Physical Sciences (PHYS 121) in term 2.

### Online homework system

The required online homework system for this course is:

> Mastering Physics 

and it is required because ----.

- Justification for "spaced practice".
- Plea to do homework and practice problems

### Lab Manual

The required **lab manual** for this course is:

> Available on Canvas, free of charge

In the past, this lab manual had to be purchased from the UBC Bookstore.
This year, because the labs are all online, a digital version of the lab manual is available to you on Canvas free of charge. 

## What should I think about if I'm considering withdrawing from the course?

First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

| Withdrawal type | Effect on Transcript | Tuition refund |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | 
| Before the 1st withdrawal date | None  | 100% refund    |
| Before the 2nd withdrawal date  | W on transcript | [0 - 50%](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=14,339,1033,0) refund depending on the date you're withdrawing |
| After the 2nd withdrawal date (cannot happen without faculty approval) | W on transcript | 0% |

There are other things to consider as well, including your graduation requirements/timelines, eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc.
I advise you to [read the full list of considerations](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/registration/late-course-changes/) here and contact your faculty advisor if you have additional questions.

## How do I do well in this course? 

### ... but I'm not good at physics!

### ... but I'm not good at math!


## What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

- Mention Learning Analytics and OnTask
- Google Analytics
- Nudge theory
- Opt-out

## What should I do if I need accommodations to be successful in this course?

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accommodations for this course are handled through the [Disability Resource Centre](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/) and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment.

[This page]() has more information about the procedure for getting accommodations in this course. 

### What if I have to miss a deadline because of a wedding, birthday, funeral, religious holiday, or personal event ?

No problem! There's not even any need to tell me, or ask for permission to miss deadlines.
The course is designed to give you maximum flexibility: 

- Every deadline has a 48-hour grace period that is automatically applied.
- There is no late penalty if you use the grace period
- You can use the grace period an unlimited amount of time in the course (though if it happens every week and for every assignment, I might check in with you and gently encourage you not to leave things to the last minute)

If you miss a deadline by more than the grace period, the general course policy is that you will get 0 on it.
In some very exceptional (i.e. rare) cases, I reserve the right to grant an extension.

### What if I have dependents that rely on me for care and unpredictable emergencies may arise?

Let's talk, send me a private message and we can discuss it.
I do not necessarily need to know all the personal details, just a high-level summary of your situation and what you think an ideal solution would be.

I'm sure we will come to some agreement, generally the earlier you let me know of any special circumstances or accommodation, the more I'll be able to do for you!

## How do I go through this course ethically and with integrity?


### UBCO's statement on Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

### My personal plea

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

## Compassion

As I'm sure you're aware, *there is a global pandemic* happening right now and we could all use some extra compassion and humanity.
If you're going through something that is affecting you (course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it. 
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you're going through, just ask.
You will *never* owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc... I will believe you, and I will trust you.
I will not judge you, nor think any less of you.
I will do everything in my power to work something that is both reasonable and fair. 
This, I promise!
