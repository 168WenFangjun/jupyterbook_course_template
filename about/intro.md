## What do I need to purchase for this course?

The following are required items for this course, and their costs (in $CAD) are:

- Textbook ($XX)
- Access to online homework system ($XX)
- Lab Manual ($0)

Being very conscious of the high costs of education, I have made efforts to minimize the additional cost of taking this course.
Below is a justification of each required item and why I think you need it to succeed in this course.

```{warning} text
Do not procrastinate buying access to the online homework system! You will need it right away.
```

### Textbook

The required **textbook** for this course is:

> [Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 4e by Randall D. Knight]()

You may purchase either Volume 1 only or the full text.
The cost for a new physical textbook is $---.
It is also possible to get a digital textbook for $---.
Volume 1 contains all of the material required for PHYS 111 and will be lighter and more portable. If you purchase the full text, it will include Volume 2 which will be used in the second part of Introductory Physics for the Physical Sciences (PHYS 121) in term 2.

### Online homework system

The required online homework system for this course is:

> Mastering Physics 

- Justification for "spaced practice".
- Plea to do homework and practice problems

### Lab Manual

The required **lab manual** for this course is:

> Available on Canvas, free of charge

In the past, this lab manual had to be purchased from the UBC Bookstore.
This year, because the labs are all online, a digital version of the lab manual is available to you on Canvas free of charge.

## Accomodations 

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accomodations for this course are handled through the [Disability Resource Cenre](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/) and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment.

### What if I have to   


### What if I have dependenants that rely on me for care?


## What do I need to know to go through this course ethically and with integrity?


### Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

### My personal plea

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).
